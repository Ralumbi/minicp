# MiniCP - Raspberry PI
MiniCP focusses on having a robust control panel for the raspberry pi using a 480x320 touch display.
As the UIs need too much modification in order to work properly in such a small screen.

The main initial setup is to offer a wifi router setup with the use of an second, but external usb wifi adapter.
